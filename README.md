# ACM-WebcamGPT
ACM-WebcamGPT, inspired by WebcamGPT-Vision, is a lightweight web application that enables users to process images from their webcam using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API. The application captures images from the user's webcam, sends them to the GPT-4 Vision API, and displays the descriptive results.
