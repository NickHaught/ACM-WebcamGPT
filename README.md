# ACM-WebcamGPT
ACM-WebcamGPT, inspired by WebcamGPT-Vision, is a lightweight web application that enables users to process images from their webcam using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API. The application captures images from the user's webcam, sends them to the GPT-4 Vision API, and displays the descriptive results.

## About Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes to the codebase, enables reverting to previous states, and supports multiple branches of development.

## What is Vite?
Vite is a modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience. It offers fast cold starts, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and overall faster build times. Vite achieves this by leveraging JavaScript's native module system (ES Modules) and pre-bundling dependencies with esbuild.

### Using TypeScript and React
This project uses TypeScript and React alongside Vite. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability. React is a library for building user interfaces, allowing us to create reusable UI components. Helpful video: [React JS Explain In 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2skans2dP4)

Vite provides out-of-the-box support for TypeScript and React, ensuring seamless development without the need for complex configuration. This setup allows us to leverage the full power of modern web development tools to build efficient, scalable applications.

## Setting Up the Project

### Installing Dependencies
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. Install Node.js if you haven't already, which includes npm. Then, install the project's dependencies at **../ACM-WebcamGPT/WebcamGPT-frontend** :
```
npm install
```

This command installs all necessary dependencies, including Vite, React, and TypeScript, as specified in the **package.json** file.

### Running the Development Server
With the dependencies installed, you can start the development server using Vite:
